                <span class="grid-text-hidden">Yes. I've truly been messing around with this project for that long. Granted I've dipped in and out and even started an elaborate alternative version which I worked on (and still do sometimes) for about a month. My aim is to learn, and make ideas come to life, so whatever thing I dream up I'm' determined to figure out and implement, like the idea of some kind of firework display if you won the game.</span>

                <span class="grid-text-hidden">
                    Before starting The Odin Prioject I had pretty much no experience in coding. I did some very minor HTML markup waycback in the last millenia but that pretty much limited me to knowing what &lt;br&gt; does</span>

                <span class="grid-text-hidden">
                    Was used whilst building this. I really tried to make a point of making new feature branches and it truly helps greatly being able to "jump" around in the history. At the beginning of this project I did not know how branches, merging, rebasing etc worked so I kept copies of files  manually and it was a total mess. Once I got the hang of branching and especially rebasing it made my development environment so much smoother and much more managable</span>

                <span class="grid-text-hidden">
                    Probably more like 1500, ha! There is a lot of junk in there though that should be cleaned up</span>

                <span class="grid-text-hidden">
                    These was really fun, and handy, to learn. I especially liked when I got the hang of listening for transition and animations starts and ends to trigger another elements action</span>

                <span class="grid-text-hidden">
                    The HTML Canvas element is pure magic and such a versitale tool to greate art and movement on the page. I used 2 canvases for the "drip effect" which displays when the player looses a game. And I used another much smaller canvas for the line which "cuts out" the rotating text</span>

                <span class="grid-text-hidden">
                    This was something I was instantly curious about once I started to get the hang of Javascript. The thought of fonts fluidly changing widths weights I just had to try out, and so I did. Perhaps to much! But hey I'm having fun here</span>

                    Well, that's what it says when I search for "Let" in my script file. That's probably not a scientific study since I'm also cathing words like "Let's PLay" but considering there are a few consts in there too it's probably not too far off</span>
